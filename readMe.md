- Iris data set summary-  (caption of Part 1)
some background!
This dataset consists of 50 records for each of three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

was used in machine learning
-	Machine learning: classifying species by size of sepal and petal; prediction of a species given certain measurement 


iii.	What do I investigate? Big Questions (caption of Part 2)
-	Scatter plot: all data, 3 species with different colors, x=sepal; y=petal
-	Histogram: y=measurement (cm); sepal & petal of @species
-	mean,median,mode,min,max of @ species or variables? Group by clause? (shown by boxplot? Histogram?)
-	Correlation? [Petal length|width] Linear Regression

iv.	Explain the dataset investigation (save as analysis.py)
- output summary of @var to text file
-how to run code
-what the code does

v.	Summary??

ii.	Summary of data set and my investigation(ReadMe)
-	Background of the dataset
-	5 variables
-	Classify species of Iris by the size of sepal and petal
-	Attribute Information:
-	1. sepal length in cm 
    2. sepal width in cm 
    3. petal length in cm 
    4. petal width in cm 
    5. class: 
        -- Iris Setosa 
        -- Iris Versicolour 
        -- Iris Virginica
-	Linear regression vs logistic regression?

To-do list:
1.	Import data, and upload to git hub
2.	Writing summary of dataset, framing questions
3.	How many plots to produce
4.	Codes/functions for plots
5.	Tidying ref and comments
